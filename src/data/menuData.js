// Default export for backward compatibility if needed, but we will use named exports mainly now.
// Since App.jsx currently uses named import { menuData }... actually wait, the previous code was:
// export const menuData = [...]
// I should keep menuData as foodData for now to avoid breaking without changing App.jsx simultaneously?
// The user request says "food option button".
// I will just export foodData and drinksData. App.jsx will be updated next.
